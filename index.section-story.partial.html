          We met in 2012 during our senior year of high school. We both attended
          the Photography classes and were assigned the same project that
          required us to shoot architectural buildings throughout New York. One
          day, we simply ran into each other on the street – we were
          photographing the same building from different points!

          We had small talk and decided to shoot together. That afternoon turned
          into a warm summer evening and ended with ice cream in a small cafe.
          We were talking and talking and talking until the shop closed.
        </p>

          A year later, we began to live together. Our love story proves that
          opposites may attract, but if you have a common passion, you will love
          each other forever.
